# This is a simplistic CRUD application made using React, Node, Express , PostgreSQL.

The application is currently under construction!


Begun to implement the back end into the App. Currently trying to connect the DB I have in Postgres and interact with the front end to display the DB entries. 

Next Task: Finalize the Back end and proceed to testing and editing the mistakes that will be present. 

Started the initial git commit with some of my Front End work just before I enter backend to deal with the db.

1. This is the initial page. Keep in mind there is no user validation.
   Table will be populated once the database is connected. Also have placeholders for the CRUD operations needed ( edit, delete )for each table entry

2. This is the create an entry modal.

# Likewise there have been made modals for the edit and delete functionalities which will be later displayed.
