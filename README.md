# This is a simplistic CRUD application made using React, Node, Express , PostgreSQL.

The application is currently under construction!

Next Task: Finalise and edit the frontend, Proceed to the backend so the app is up and running.

Started the initial git commit with some of my Front End work just before I enter backend to deal with the db.

1. This is the initial page. Keep in mind there is no user validation.
   Table will be populated once the database is connected. Also have placeholders for the CRUD operations needed ( edit, delete )for each table entry

# Likewise there have been made modals for the edit and delete functionalities which will be later displayed.
