This is the first patch of the application

Made some UI changes and configured the back end using Express and PostgreSQL.

UPDATE: Loom video presentation containing the current state of the application is up.

TASKS: a) Format the date to be shown as Greeks read it ( DD-MM-YYYY ) .
       b) Check Box instead of the Boolean variables in the Activity Tab.
       c) Notifications and alerts for better user experience during the CRUD operations.
       d) Routing the app (that includes making different screens and not being a SPA)
       e) Make a few UI changes and preparations for the final presentation.
       
       
This is the landing page. Due to the fact that there is no authentication for the app, the user is directed to the main page.

1. Here the user can see the list of Employees currently on the DB ( or currently registered at the company) and their respective attributes.

2. The user can add an new Employee using this form on the left of the page.

And you can see on the rigt that the new entry is added.

3. Here you can edit an employee entry using the action button on the right of the entry you want to edit.
   You can see the edit form taking the place of the new employee form.

4. Similarly, the user can Delete an entry by using the 'Delete' action Button. That way the entry is dropped from the table and the DB.
