# This is a simplistic CRUD application made using React, Node, Express , PostgreSQL.

First patch of changes to the application.

Made some UI changes and configured the back end using Express and PostgreSQL.

UPDATE: Loom video presentation containing the current state of the application is up.
       
**This is the landing page. Due to the fact that there is no authentication for the app, the user is directed to the main page.**

**1. Here the user can see the list of Employees currently on the DB ( or currently registered at the company) and their respective attributes.**

**2. The user can add an new Employee using this form on the left of the page.**

And you can see on the right that the new entry is added.

**3. Here you can edit an employee entry using the action button on the right of the entry you want to edit.
   You can see the edit form taking the place of the new employee form.**

**4. Similarly, the user can Delete an entry by using the 'Delete' action Button. That way the entry is dropped from the table and the DB.**
